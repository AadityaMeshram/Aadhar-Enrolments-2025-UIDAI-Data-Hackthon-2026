# Aadhar-Enrolments-2025-UIDAI-Data-Hackthon-2026
As part of the UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026, organized by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in association with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), I worked on an end-to-end data analytics project using Aadhaar Enrolment open data, identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, or predictive indicators and translate them into clear insights or solution frameworks that can support informed decision-making, system improvements and policy making, created 15 page report about this for Hackthon.

🔍 What I worked on
Cleaned and analyzed Aadhaar enrolment data across states, Union Territories, districts, pincodes, age groups, and time periods.
Built an Power BI dashboard to explore enrolment trends, regional disparities, and demographic patterns.
Performed time-series, geographic, and age-wise analysis to identify saturation, growth areas, and anomalies.

📈 Key insights
~65% of enrolments are driven by the 0–5 age group, indicating strong early-life Aadhaar registration.
Adult enrolment (~3%) is largely saturated, shifting focus toward updates and data quality.
High-population states dominate enrolment volumes, while district and pincode-level analysis reveals micro-level gaps.
Clear seasonality in enrolments aligned with academic cycles and government outreach programs.

🧠 What this demonstrates
Strong hands-on experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
Ability to translate raw public data into actionable insights for policy and decision-making.
Experience working on real-world, large-scale government datasets under a hackathon setting.
